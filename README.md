# RetroJoystick
This repository is for arduino sketch(es) and other material related to my joystick project

The version 3 uploaded here works great with the Feather nRF52 to create a Bluetooth joystick that is mapped to the Amiga Forever standard keyboard layout. I also have mouse buttons working on this as I have another use for this controller to create a remote for a Plasma cutting table that needs nearly the same setup as a joystick.  So this device is acting as a Keyboard/Mouse at the moment and not an HID Joystick controller.
